Problem Statment : Given an sorted integer array of size N which is also rotated by an unknown position. Input Array is not monotonically increasing as it is rotated at some unknown pivot element. We have to find the pivot element of array.

Pivot element is the only element in input array which is smaller than it's previous element. A pivot element divided a sorted rotated array into two monotonically increasing array.

Solution : 

### By linearly searching input Array
In sorted and rotated array, pivot element(minimum element) is the only element which is smaller than it's previous element.

Traverse inputArray from index 0 to N-1 and search for an element inputArray[i] which is smaller than previous element inputArray[i-1].


### By Binary Search

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int getPivotElement(int *array, int left, int right){
  	if(array[left] <= array[right]) return left;
  	while(left <= right){
  		int mid = (left + right) /2;
  		if(array[mid] > array[mid+1]) return mid+1;
  		else if(array[left] <= array[mid]){
  			left = mid+1;
  		}
  		else {
  			right = mid-1;
  		}
  	}
}
 
int main(){
    int arr[11] = {16, 18, 22, 25, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14};
  
   	cout << getPivotElement(arr, 0, 10);
    return 0;
}
