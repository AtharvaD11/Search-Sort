Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Problem Statement : There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 Solution 1 : Linear Search (Trivial)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution 2 : Binary Search 

If the sorted array is rotated, we get two array segments that are sorted.<br>
We just need to look into the segment that contains the target element;

Code 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() -1;
        int idx = -1;
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                idx = mid;
            }
            // check if the left portion of mid is sorted or not
            if(nums[low] <= nums[mid]){
                // check if target lies in the left portion
                if(nums[low] <= target && nums[mid] >= target){
                    high = mid-1;
                }
                else low = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                if(nums[mid+1] <= target && nums[high] >= target){
                    low = mid+1;
                }
                else high = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return idx;
    }
};

TC : O(log(n))
SC : O(1)
